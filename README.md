This project uses a gantry system controlled by two Arduino Unos and a CNC shield to magnetically control a ball, making designs in the sand.

Thank you Noah for the table :)

## Troubleshooting

The x limit switch sometimes gets missed when homing, causing the system to jam. When this occurs, cut power and manually move magnet to the left.
Ensure that the laser cut parts are pushed down into place; they move upwards over time.
